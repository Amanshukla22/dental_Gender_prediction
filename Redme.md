🔹 Project Workflow:
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values & scaling
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding patterns in data
3️⃣ Feature Engineering – Selecting important features
4️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation – Comparing model accuracy
5️⃣ Saving Model – Exporting trained model as .pkl file

🔹 Files Included:
📌 Dental Gender Prediction.ipynb – Full Jupyter Notebook with code & explanations
📌 dental_gender_model.pkl – Trained model file
📌 README.md – Project documentation
   dataset uploaded

🚀 How to Use the Model?
🔹 Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells
🔹 Upload a dataset in CSV format
🔹 The model will predict gender based on dental attributes
